          Hi there! My name is Matvei, and I'm thrilled to share a little bit about myself with you. I'm a web developer
          with a passion for creating beautiful and functional digital experiences. My journey in web development began
          in 2020, and since then, I've had the privilege of working with a diverse range of clients, from small
          businesses to larger corporations. Currently, I work as a freelancer, and I love the variety of projects that
          come my way.
          <br /> <br />
          In the past, I worked with a student-led web studio where I honed my skills in building user-centric websites.
          I also had the opportunity to work with an Israeli start-up where I learned how to work in a fast-paced, agile
          environment.
          <br /> <br />
          Overall, I'm a dedicated and passionate web developer who is committed to creating engaging, user-friendly
          experiences on the web. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I hope to hear from you
          soon!
